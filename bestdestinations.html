            <h2>Milan</h2>
            <p>
                Milan is an old town in Northern Italy, renowned for its incredible advances in medicine.
                Visiting Milan is not only for medicine fans, however. The city's awe-inspiring Gothic architecture
                can take one's breath away! With its towering cathedrals and winding pathways, it will be like taking
                a stroll through back in time to the Victorian era. While visiting Milan, you may also like to visit
                the old castle of Castello Cova and uncover its incredible history.

            <h2>Munich</h2>
            <p>
                Much more than the center of Oktoberfest, Munich is an intricate layering of Bavarian culture,
                a complicated World War II past, and, yes, some of the best effervescent beverages in the world.
                Once a quaint Alpine city, Munich has evolved into a veritable cultural capital.
                Shaped by a set of incredibly diverse forces, Munich’s city center tells stories of monks 
                and monasteries, the Bavarian Royal family, Hofbräuhaus beer, 
                and Bavarian specialties like bratwurst and spätzle. Immerse yourself in the magic of Munich
                with Context's private and small group guided tours.</p>

            <h2>Sofia</h2>
            <p>
                Situated in the heart of the Balkan peninsula, at the foot of the spectacular
                Vitosha mountain, Sofia is a modern, elegant, cosmopolitan and vibrant city, 
                filled with green areas and parks, and has a historic centre dotted with majestic monuments.
                After Athens and Rome, it is one of the oldest city in Europe and the remains of its ancient 
                foundations are still visible. Since the end of the era of communist dictatorship, Sofia has
                “opened up” to the world and tourism, and is ready to uncover its millenary history, splendid works 
                of art and beautiful surrounding countryside.
